Q)-Absolute difference divisible by K
Given an array of integers of size n and an integer k, find all the pairs in the array whose absolute difference is divisible by k.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 3
arr[] = {3, 7, 11}
k = 4
Output:
3
Explanation:
(11-3) = 8 is divisible by 4
(11-7) = 4 is divisible by 4
(7-3) = 4 is divisible by 4

Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
k = 2
Output :
2
Explanation:
Valid pairs are (1,3), and (2,4).

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countPairs() which takes integers n, array arr[ ], integer k as input parameters and returns the number of pairs whose absolute difference is divisible by k.
Note: The answer may be large so use 64-bit integer. 


Expected Time Complexity: O(n + k)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(k)


Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ k,arr[i] ≤ 105


Ans)-
class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, n, arr, k):
        
        # intialize the count
        cnt = 0
      
        # making every element of arr in
        # range 0 to k - 1
        for i in range(n):
            arr[i] = (arr[i] + k) % k
      
        # create an array hash
        hash = [0]*k
      
        # store to count of element of arr
        # in hash
        for i in range(n):
            hash[arr[i]] += 1
      
        # count the pair whose absolute
        # difference is divisible by k
        for i in range(k):
            cnt += (hash[i] * (hash[i] - 1)) // 2
      
        # return the value of count
        return cnt
        }
