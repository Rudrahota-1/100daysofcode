Q)-Count even length
Given a number n, find count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits.
The anwer can be very large. So, you have to return answer modulo 109+7.

Example:

Input: n = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 sequences of length 
2*n, the sequences are 0101, 0110, 1010, 1001, 
0000 and 1111.
Example:

Input: n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 sequence of length 
2*n, the sequence are 00 and 11.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anyhting. Your task is to complete the function compute_value() which takes n as input parameter and returns count of all binary sequence of length 2*n such that sum of first n bits is same as sum of last n bits modulo 109 + 7.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(n * log(n))
Expected Space Complexity:  O(1)
 

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105

Answer)-
class Solution:
    def compute_value(self, n):
        mod=10**9+7
        if n==1:
            return 2
        val=2
        for i in range(1,n):
            val=(val*((2*i)+1)*2)%mod
            x=pow(i+1,mod-2,mod)
            val=(val*x)%mod
        return val
}
